Homework 2 - Coffee Shop 


Summary: 
The purpose of the program is to read and analyze the sales data of a coffee shop. The data stored in text files 
which the program will read and analyze. The three primary functions of the program help to calculate the overall 
revenue of all the sales by using the itemcode and the price for each item. The second function is resposible for 
calculating the register balance which is principle amount of money the user has. The third function "tally" 
calculates the sales for an item and tallies the number of times a particular item was sold. The program also asks 
for the user's choice of which program they want to run and the input file which has all the data that they want the 
program to read and analyze. If the user choses option 3, then they will have to chose an output file where their item 
would be stored if they chose to append. To run the program it needs to be complied again using the commands C:\Users\Vivek\Desktop\
Term C\CS_2303_Projects\Homework\Homework 2.0> to save it to the right folder and then gcc calendar.c to compile it and then 
.\sales.exe because that was how it executes the program through the makefile. Initially, I had problems getting the right logic 
for each of the three functions. Though I was able to fix it by finding the right snytax for the while statement. The 
most difficult problem was being able figure out how to open the file and reading aand then saving the input from the user 
to the output file. 

To Compile: 
gcc .\coffee_shop.c .\calculations.c

To execute: 
.\sales.exe

I have discussed the assignment details and brainstromed ways to approach the program with Jahnavi Prudhivi. 
We shared ideas of how to think about the logic for each of the functions and Jahnavi Prudhivi has helped 
to think about the logic closely and look for errors. In addition I have went to office hours and the used 
the help of SA's to clear any doubts and get a better idea of the logic should go and the basic syntax for printing, 
scanning, opening and reading files.
