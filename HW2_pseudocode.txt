Homework 2 Pseudocode 

In the main() function 
Initialize all the variables needed for the program to run 
Make two char variables; one for the input file and one for the output file and set them to [50] and not [100] to avoid disruptions 
Make an int variable for the user item 
Make two pointers FILE * ; one for opening the input file and one for opening the output file 
Ask for the user to choose between the three program; 1, 2, 3 respectively 
Add an if statement to check if the user picked only programs 1, 2, or 3. If not then print an "Invalid Statement" 
Ask for the user to enter an input file they desire 
Open the input file the user asks for 
Use a switch statement for the 3 main programs 
Case 1 will go through the function overall_revenue, 
Case 2 will go through the function balance,
Case 3 will go through the tally function 
Additionally for case 3 (tally function) ask the user what item they want to analyze 
Ask the user what output file they want their item to be stored in 
Ask the user if they want to append the input or over-write 
If user types 'A' or 'a' which means they clicked append then it will put in the output file 
Next open the output file 
Include an if statement to check if the file asked by the user is NULL and then print NULL <- This is not crucial for the program to run 
Print the item and the tally function in the output file 
Make a separate source file for the three functions 

Functions
For the first function; overall_revenue use a while loop and fscanf to check if the itemcode and price of the item is after the 0 column 
Add the price to the revenue variable 
Return the revenue variable 
For the balance function, do the same while loop used for overall_revenue and then add the price to the balance variable 
Return the variable 
For the lst function tally, do the same while loop used for overall_revenue
Declare a variable counter which will be used for getting the tally 
Check if the if the itemCode equals to the item inputted by the user
Increment the counter variable to the number of times a particular item was sold
Return the counter variable which will be the number of times the item was sold 
For the program to use all the functions to run, include a header.h file which will have the function prototypes of overall_revenue, balance, and tally
Finally have a makefile which will be used to compile all the files in the program and make sure there isn't any warnings or errors
